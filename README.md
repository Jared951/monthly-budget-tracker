The Monthly-Budget-Tracker is a simple application that allows users to track their income and expenses for the month to calculate how much money they have left over.
The technologies used are: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end and back-end server files

The first feature of the application is that a user is able to input their expenses or income. They are able to type in a name for it, choose between the two types, and then enter in the amount it is. Once the user has entered these they are able to click the "Add Expense or Income" button to populate the second table.
